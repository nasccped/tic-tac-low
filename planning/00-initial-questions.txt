                    Initial Questions

What do I want?

  A tic tac toe game, mostly done in the C language

  Not a so simple game! I want a cool game interface

  I want to use as few libraries as possible. There are a bunch of
  cool things that you can do with some libs, but in this way I
  will fall into some random youtube tutorial hell and someone else
  would end up doing the project for me

  My goal isn't make an efficient program. I just want the program
  to look the way I imagine it, without using tutorials or AI. The
  main objective is to fix the problems that appear on the way,
  alone, thus working on my ability to solve problems



How can I do this?

  Honestly, I have no idea :^B

  I'm just tired of procrastinating and decided to finally start
  development

  Currently, I'm thinking about a ( do <-> test ) way. It's a good
  development method

  But what now? I start by doing the visuals? the logic? I dont know



Is there a redline?

  No! I don't know when I'll finish (or if I'll finish)

  All I want is some kind of progress, otherwise... well, no project :P
