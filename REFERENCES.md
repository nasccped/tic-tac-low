### Makefiles

#### GNU Make Manual

How can I create a variable inside a script block? How can I updated
it? Why it's so hard? ðŸ˜­

- [GNU Website](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html)


#### Conditionals

By the looks, I need to performe an `ifeq/ifneq` outside a recipe.

- [GNU Website](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Conditional-Syntax.html)


#### Directory Already Exists

I need to test it, store into a string-list variable to use it in a recipe
later. I need to test it outside a recipe previously. ðŸ’€
